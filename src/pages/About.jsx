        population using intelligent technology. With cutting-edge fall detection,

        peace of mind for families and care facilities.

          More than 36 million falls are reported among older adults each year. Most happen at home, often without witnesses.
          We created ElderGuard to bring real-time protection, alerts, and assurance to families and care providers alike â€”
          using AI for good.
